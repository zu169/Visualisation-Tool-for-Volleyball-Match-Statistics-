Motivation: 

Match statistic presentation is an important factor in the progression for volleyball athletes at the University of Aberystwyth. Currently, the presentation of these statistics is inefficient and lacks clarity in the identification of strengths and weaknesses for the individual. The clear visualisation of these statistics would likely encourage specified skill development and allow for comparative improvement between past and present performances. An intuitive presentation of the data which potentially includes motivational benefits dependent on the individual. With objective outlines allowing athletes to have targets to build towards.
