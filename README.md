# Visualisation Tool for Volleyball Match Statistics
The Volleyball Visualisation Tool is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to manage, display, and analyse match and player data for both men's and women's volleyball teams. It aims to streamline data management, enhance performance tracking, and support data-driven decision-making through intuitive tools and visualizations. 

**Key Components:** 

Data Management: Efficient handling of match records, player profiles, and performance metrics.

Data Manipulation: Advanced filtering, sorting, and graphing tools for in-depth analysis. 
User Authentication: Secure login platform with role-based access control.

**Motivation:**

Match statistic presentation is an important factor in the progression for volleyball athletes at the University of Aberystwyth. Currently, the presentation of these statistics is inefficient and lacks clarity in the identification of strengths and weaknesses for the individual. The clear visualisation of these statistics would likely encourage specified skill development and allow for comparative improvement between past and present performances. An intuitive presentation of the data which potentially includes motivational benefits dependent on the individual. With objective outlines allowing athletes to have targets to build towards.
